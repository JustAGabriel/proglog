Code created while working through "Distributed Services with Go" by Travis Jeffery.

### potential improvements

- arrange code blocks/sections in the book to always result in complete code. sometimes it takes a whole chapter to have complete/valid code again. the code written should be complete after each code block. i think this would make the code easier to follow in general and to chunk changes logically for commits.
